      "value": "<p>A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific celestial body, such as a supergiant star for a heliad queen. As long as the queen is healthy, her territory thrives, and she can attempt to counteract spells and rituals that alter its physical properties using her spell attack roll with a counteract rank equal to the highest-rank spell she can cast. If a nymph queen is injured or unhealthy, however, her celestial body also weakens: asteroids wobble out of orbit, stars dim, and the gravity of black holes diminishes. Restoring the nymph queen returns her celestial body to its equilibrium.</p>",
